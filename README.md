## Building on iOS

For the very first build on iOS, follow these steps. For all subsequent builds, these steps will not be needed.

1. Navigate to project directory, then to the ios directory.
    ```cd ios```
2. Run pod install. This step will take about 5 minutes so feel free to step away for a while.
    ```pod install```
3. Build the app as usual
    ```flutter run```

The first build will take longer than usual but subsequent (cached) builds will be faster. First build in this situation would be builds after some period of time (ie. Building for the first time that day or some amount of hours later when it is no longer cached)

## Building on Android

Build and run as usual.
